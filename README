NAME
    Devel::Cover::Report::Cobertura - Backend for Cobertura reporting of
    coverage statistics

SYNOPSIS
     cover -report cobertura

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a cobertura compatible coverage xml file which can
    be used in Gitlab

    It is designed to be called from the "cover" program distributed with
    Devel::Cover Devel::Cover::Report::Clover.

    It is implemented as sub class of Devel::Cover::Report::Clover with a
    different template

OPTIONS
    Options are specified by adding the appropriate flags to the "cover"
    program. This report format supports the following:

    outputfile
        This will be the file name that you would like to write this report
        out to. It defaults to cobertura.xml.

    projectname
        This is simply a cosmetic item. When the xml is generated, it has a
        project name which will show up in your continuous integration
        system once it is parsed. This can be any string you want and it
        defaults to 'Devel::Cover::Report::Cobertura'.
